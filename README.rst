Die Allgäuer Bergsteiger-Gruppe

The idea:

Starting from the Kempten alpine club section, but open to members of all sections in the Allgäu region,
we want to establish a group with the characteristic name Camp10, which is dedicated to ambitious
mountaineering and operates this in the european Alps and worldwide:

* In the Alps and worldwide demanding, long mountain rides, moderate expeditions
  and high altitude mountaineering as group excursions - no guided tours.
* Platform for youngsters from the young teams (Jungmannschaften) to grow
  into demanding mountaineering and gain experience.
* Difficulties and requirements clearly go beyond the level normally offered on section tours.

In this repository we manage the source for our blog at http://camp10.info
